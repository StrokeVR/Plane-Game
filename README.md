# Plane-Game
This project is part of a group of Unity Engine built Oculus Rift VR games for stroke patient rehabilitation. 
-----
The objective of the game is for the player to throw toy planes through hoops. 
Patients develop hand-eye coordination and practice arm extension movements needed for day-to-day activities.
